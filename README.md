This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

To install and configure the App. It is ready to launch upon finalization of this command.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

*The application relies heavily on the fact you are using _localhost_ as development domain*. It is important to keep it that way in order to bypass CORS and CSP restrictions.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
